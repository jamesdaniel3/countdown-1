        Hi! I'm James and I am a third year student at the University of
        Virginia. I am studying Computer Science and Economics. Outside of
        school, I spend a lot of my time as a TA for a couple of Computer
        Science classes at UVA, and I really enjoy helping people learn. In my
        spare time I like to listen to and play music. I grew up playing piano,
        guitar, and drums, and I'm now starting to build a bit of a record
        collection. Anyone at UVA should check out Roots, Rock, Reggae on the
        corner if they want to buy or just browse some cool records. If you want
        to learn more about me professionally, check out my LinkedIn
